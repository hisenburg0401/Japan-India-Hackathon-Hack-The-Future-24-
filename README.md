# Japan India Hack-a-thon (Hack The Future'24)
This repository contains all the required files as well as the presentation that was submitted by Team Eta in the Japan India Hack-a-thon (Hack the Future - 2024).
Problem Statement: REDUCTION OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN AHMEDABAD CITY
Solution proposed: Using a Smart and Adaptive Traffic Signal

Details:
1) We developed a Traffic Signal that can take the CCTV camera feed video as input and using CV models such as Fusion Image, AIPF for image processing.
2) A hard coded and efficient algorithm for the vehicle detection and counting.

Advantages of the proposed solution:
1) Reducing of the delay time caused by non-adaptive traffic signals.
2) We don't require the high quality images for training CNN models, we can directly use the processed image to train the CNN models.
3) Works very well for a developing country like India.
4) Very cost effective and efficient method.
5) Can be implemented directly into the Indian Traffic Managemnt System without many changes in the system.

Due to this efficient and sustainable solution we won the 3rd place (2nd Runner Up) in the Japan India Hack-a-thon (Hack the Future'24)
